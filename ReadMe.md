- despite my experience coding in JS before, I never truly gained an understanding of what I was doing so we will go back to learning as if I have zero experience but with a full time job, I'm just going to learn as I please instead of a strict schedule
- i have just been looking at examples and modeling after them but not really understanding why () or {} or ending methods and variables with ;
